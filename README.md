## What is the use of a notebook?
<div>
	<p align="justify">
		The use of a notebook is not limited to a few. A notebook is a space for writing anything, so it can be used in many ways.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Also, due to the fact that people's spirits are different, so everyone can have a special use for it. Of course, having a notebook is one of the special characteristics of successful people.
	<p>
</div>

## What is the first use of a notebook?
<div>
	<p align="justify">
		The corner of a successful person's life is always a notebook. Of course, in their view, this small object is not only related to a corner of life, but its role is very central and important.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Almost all of us have known and experienced this use of the notebook, at least in the school years, even in many cases, as required by teachers and educators. We need to know that it has been a good thing for us that we have learned how to write down our tasks and do everything in order. So it is better to resume this habit.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		The miracle of writing the eternal slogan of the most successful people on the planet. I do not mean just celebrities; Rather, they are those who both feel happy and satisfied with life and have brought real benefits to their fellow human beings.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Although reminders on cell phones and other electronic devices seem to have made us needless of the notebook, they still cannot be a perfect replacement for this lovely object with the pleasant sound of its pages.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		The notebook allows us to write down our daily, weekly, monthly and even annual tasks and keep them up to date. Which electronic reminder will give you the good feeling of ticking your goals or successfully completed tasks on paper ?!
	<p>
</div>

## What is a note or daily report in a notebook?
<div>
	<p align="justify">
		Notes and reports are the best help to evaluate our performance, how many tasks and tasks we have done around the clock.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Reports are a kind of autobiographical history that helps us to examine events and their course and results. This use of notebooks helps us especially in the fields of education, work and profession.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Some people basically need a notebook for their job and career. For example, can you imagine journalism without a notebook ?! There are many other jobs and activities for which, although notepad is not the main tool of the work, but it will certainly have a great impact on the recording and implementation of ideas.
	<p>
</div>

## What is better than memories?
<div>
	<p align="justify">
		What could be more appealing to a writer than a white sheet of paper in front of him and a pen in hand? Writing does not mean that you must be the creator of a thousand-page novel. The best start for those who like this is to write personal memoirs continuously and daily.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		This may be a form of reporting, but in memoir writing it usually takes on a more personal aspect. You can write down events that are important to you and include your personal opinion on those events in the writing.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		You can write down your personal thoughts, feelings and desires in a notebook and keep it in a safe place that is only available to you.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		For professional diaries, there have definitely been times when they have looked through the diaries of years ago. Facing the attitudes and feelings of the past is an interesting event in itself, and in many cases it will create humorous and funny moments, and this is the most fascinating use of the notebook.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Maybe you are not so interested in daily writing. What about travel memories? Isn't it a pity, seeing the attractions of travel, not to record them so that you have a comprehensive and complete description along with the countless photos you take?
	<p>
</div>

## What to write in the notebook?
<div>
	<p align="justify">
		What would you like to write in a notebook? The use of a notebook is not really limited and you can use it in any way. However, having a notebook in your bag is essential.
	<p>
	<p align="justify">
		Some of the other most important uses of a notebook are:
	<p>
</div>

* Record topics of interest (books, movies, music, ...)
* Record recipes for favorite and useful foods and drinks
* Record beautiful and lovely poems
* Record work and personal appointment times
* Record the steps of a task and forecasts
* Capture creative ideas that come to mind at the moment

## Platform limitations (UWP):

* You won't be able to save files to system folders due to UWP restriction (windows, system32, etc.).
* You cannot associate potentially harmful file types (.cmd, .bat etc.) with Notepads.
* Notepads does not work well with large files; the file size limit is set to 1MB for now. I will add large file support later.

## Pending
* he WFA version is not yet complete, I mean to add different styles to the project
* WPF folder
